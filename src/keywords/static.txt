static means belongs to the class, not to individual objects.
You can access static members without creating an object.Directly you can access them with class name.

Static Variables
    Shared across all objects of the class.
    Memory allocated only once (in method area, not heap).

Static Methods
    Can be called without creating an object.
    Cannot access non-static (instance) members directly.

Static Blocks
    Runs only once when the class is first loaded into memory.
    Commonly used to initialize static variables.

Static Classes
    Only nested classes can be declared static (i.e., inner class inside another class).
    A static nested class does not need an object of the outer class.

static methods cannot use this or super (since they donâ€™t belong to any instance).
