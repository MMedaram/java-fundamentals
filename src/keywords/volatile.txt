volatile is a keyword/modifier you can apply to a variable.
It tells the JVM and compiler:
    “Always read/write this variable directly from main memory, not from CPU thread cache.”

Normally in Java:
    Each thread can keep its own copy of a variable in CPU cache.
    If one thread updates it, other threads may not immediately see the new value.

With volatile:
    Every read/write goes straight to main memory.
    All threads always see the most recent value.
