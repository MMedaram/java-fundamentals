strictfp is a modifier in Java.
It makes floating-point calculations (float, double) follow the IEEE 754 standard (a universal floating-point arithmetic standard).
This ensures platform-independent results for floating-point operations.

Why do we need it?
    Different CPUs (Intel, AMD, ARM, etc.) may use different levels of precision (like 32-bit, 64-bit, or even 80-bit).
    Without strictfp, the result of floating-point calculations may vary across platforms.
    With strictfp, Java forces all floating-point math to stick to 32-bit for float and 64-bit for double, ensuring consistent results everywhere.

Where can we use strictfp?
    On classes
    On interfaces
    On methods
    ❌ Not allowed on variables, constructors, or abstract methods.

When to use it?
    Use it when you want predictable, same results across all machines, especially in financial, scientific, or banking systems where precision matters.
    In modern Java, it’s rarely used because the JVM already ensures consistent results in most cases.
